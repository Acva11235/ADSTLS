## üìù Overview

Urban traffic congestion remains a significant challenge, leading to increased travel times ‚è≥, fuel consumption, and environmental pollution. Traditional fixed-time or locally adaptive traffic signal controllers often struggle to manage complex, network-wide traffic dynamics effectively.

This project introduces an intelligent traffic signal control system designed to optimize traffic flow across a network of intersections. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the system dynamically adapts signal phases based on real-time, network-wide traffic conditions.

**Objective:** To develop and rigorously evaluate a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) system using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the traffic network state and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to learn optimal signal control policies for multiple intersections simultaneously.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Multi-Intersection Control:** Manages traffic signals at multiple intersections concurrently.
*   **GNN State Representation:** Captures spatial dependencies and network-level traffic patterns using PyTorch Geometric (PyG).
*   **Deep Q-Learning (DQN):** Employs Stable Baselines3 (SB3) for robust and efficient DQN implementation.
*   **SUMO Simulation:** Uses the microscopic traffic simulator SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) for realistic environment modeling.
*   **Adaptive Control:** Learns policies that adapt to dynamic traffic conditions.
*   **Modular Design:** Easily configurable components (network, agent, training parameters).
